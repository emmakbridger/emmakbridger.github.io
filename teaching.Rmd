*What else am I up to?*

I teach a range of social and cognitive psychology topics (power & hierarchy, intergroup relations, racism, sexism, history of social psychology, attitudes, misinformation, polarisation, intertemporal choice, adversity and cognitive outcomes) across modules, levels and courses within the School of Psychology and Vision Sciences at University of Leicester.

I am a SEDA-qualified doctoral supervisor and part of the supervisory team for a number of funded PhD students. If you are interested in a PhD, particularly behavioural science projects that lie at the intersection between social cognition, social inequality and health, do get in touch.

I am a member of the following networks and organisations:  
* [British Psychological Society](https://www.bps.org.uk/)  
* [Psychologists for Social Change](http://www.psychchange.org/)  
* [Medact Economic Justice and Health](https://www.medact.org/membership/groups/economic-justice-health/)
