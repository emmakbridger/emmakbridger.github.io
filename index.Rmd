Hello! I am a Lecturer in Psychology, at the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk). My background is in experimental psychology and memory although my research interests now cover a very broad range of behavioural science topics. 

Many of my current interests lie at the intersection between well-being, health, socioeconomic inequality and social psychology. 

But that's not all I'm up to - I spend a lot of time thinking about how to both teach and apply ethics and open science principles. Do have a look around to see more, check out research activities and pre-registrations at [osf.io/gmz9h](https://osf.io/gmz9h) or get in touch with me directly at eb441[dot][at]leicester[dot]ac[dot]uk.
